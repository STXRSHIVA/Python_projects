    - Addition (`+`)
    - Subtraction (`-`)
    - Multiplication (`*`)
    - Division (`/`)
- Input validation for operator
- Rounds results to three decimal places

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or copy the code into your Python environment.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter:
    
    bash
    
    Copy code
    
    `python calculator.py`
    
3. Follow the prompts:
    - Enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
    - Enter the first number
    - Enter the second number
4. The result of the operation will be displayed rounded to three decimal places.
